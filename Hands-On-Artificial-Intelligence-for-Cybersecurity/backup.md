## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example,

The code will look like the following:
```
In [ ]:
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA   

pca = PCA(n_components=2)               
pca.fit(X_data)                         
X_2D = pca.transform(X_data)            
data_df['PCA1'] = X_2D[:, 0]
data_df['PCA2'] = X_2D[:, 1]
```
